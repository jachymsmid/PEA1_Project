# Project for the course Programmnig of Engineering Applicatioins

The problem we chose for this project is an advection equation in 2D\
$$u_t+au_x = 0$$

The problem will be solved using the Finite Difference Method. Multiple schemes will be tried and compared/evaluated.

### 1. Lax-Friedrichs scheme

### 2. Lax-Wendorf scheme

### 3. Upwind scheme
